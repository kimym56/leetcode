```sh
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```
```sh
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
```
```python
class Solution:
  def wordBreak(self, s, wordDict ):
    word_set = set(wordDict)  # convert wordDict to a set for constant time lookup
    n = len(s)
    dp = [False] * (n+1)  # create an array dp of length n+1
    dp[0] = True  # empty string can be segmented into an empty sequence of words
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i):
            if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_set:
                dp[i] = True
                break
    return dp[n]  # return the final answer
```
