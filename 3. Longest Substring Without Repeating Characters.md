```sh
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

#My Code(O(n^2))

            count = 0

                if(lst[ord(jv)]==0):
                    lst[ord(jv)]+=1
                    count += 1
                else:

#Better Code(O(n))

    char_index = {}

    start = 0  
    for end in range(len(s)):
        if s[end] in char_index and char_index[s[end]] >= start:
            start = char_index[s[end]] + 1  
        char_index[s[end]] = end 
        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)
    return max_length
