```sh
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```
```python
#My Code
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        i = 0
        j = 1
        maxP = 0
        l=len(prices)
        while j<l:
            d=prices[j]-prices[i]
            if prices[i]<prices[j]:
                maxP = max(d,maxP)
            else :
                i = j
            j += 1
        return maxP
```
```python
#Better Code
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        minPrice = prices[0]
        maxProfit = 0
        for i in prices:
            minPrice = min(i, minPrice)
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, i-minPrice)
        return maxProfit
```
